/*body: Applied a margin of 8px to the body element to provide spacing
 around the entire content and set its display type to block (though 
 it's the default display type for the body).

#mainHeading: Used the ID selector to target the <h1> element with the
 ID of "mainHeading". This can be used to modify specific styles for 
 this heading, such as changing the font color and size.

#funParagraph: Utilized the class selector to target paragraphs with 
the class "funParagraph". This allows for specific styling of
 paragraphs with this class, like adding a background color and 
 padding to make them visually distinct.

Make sure the HTML file (index.html) and the CSS file (styles.css)
are in the same folder for the styles to apply correctly. Adjust the
 CSS styling properties as needed to achieve the desired visual
 effects.*/
