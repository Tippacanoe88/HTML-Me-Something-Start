         <p id="funParagraph">Since I was a kid, I always wanted to see the mountains. The country's national parks and all of its wonders. So for years, I planned a trip.</p>

         <p id="secondParagraph">In May of 2023, me and six friends rented a van, and took the 25 hour drive out west to see what these parks had in store.</p>

         <p id="thirdParagraph"> For what felt like only seconds, we drove OVER the Teton Mountain range to get to our destination. A modern Oregon Trail journey through the most beautiful sights in the country.</p>

         <p id="concludingParagraph">Our final destination was finally here. After a whole day and night's drive, we had finally made it. We got to see first hand the prehistoric waters coming back to the surface from the Prismatic springs geysers. We got to see the canyon where the park earned it's name. We got to see herds of Bison grazing in large pastures. What an amazing sight to see. This is where I belong. And I hope everyone gets a chance to experience this for themselves.</p>
